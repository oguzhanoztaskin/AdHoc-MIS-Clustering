\summary
Write your abstract here.

An abstract summarizes, in one paragraph (usually), the major aspects of the entire paper in the following prescribed sequence \cite{Anderson2016}:
\begin{itemize}
\item the question(s) you investigated (or purpose), (from Introduction)
state the purpose very clearly in the first or second sentence.
\item the experimental design and methods used; clearly express the basic design of the study; name or briefly describe the basic methodology used without going into excessive detail-be sure to indicate the key techniques used.
\item the major findings including key quantitative results, or trends; report those results which answer the questions you were asking; identify trends, relative change or differences, etc.
\item a brief summary of your interpretations and conclusions; clearly state the implications of the answers your results gave you.
\end{itemize}

The length of your Abstract should be kept to about 200-300 words maximum. Limit your statements concerning each segment of the paper (i.e. purpose, methods, results, etc.) to two or three sentences. The Abstract helps readers decide whether they want to read the rest of the paper, or it may be the only part they can obtain via electronic literature searches or in published abstracts. Therefore, enough key information (e.g., summary results, observations, trends, etc.) must be included to make the Abstract useful to someone who may to reference your work~\cite{Anderson2016}.

How do you know when you have enough information in your Abstract? A simple rule-of-thumb is to imagine that you are another researcher doing an study similar to the one you are reporting. If your Abstract was the only part of the paper you could access, would you be happy with the information presented there?

The Abstract is ONLY text. Use the active voice when possible, but much of it may require passive constructions. Write your Abstract using concise, but complete, sentences, and get to the point quickly. The Abstract SHOULD NOT contain~\cite{Anderson2016}:
\begin{itemize}
\item  lengthy background information,
\item  references to other literature,
\item  elliptical (i.e., ending with ...) or incomplete sentences,
\item  abbreviations or terms that may be confusing to readers,
\item  any sort of illustration, figure, or table, or references to them.
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}

Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are self-organizing systems of mobile nodes that operate without any fixed infrastructure. This inherent flexibility is their greatest strength but also their primary challenge. The constantly changing network topology makes traditional routing protocols, which assume stable links, inefficient and unable to scale. In large, dynamic MANETs, the control message overhead required to maintain routing information can overwhelm the network, a phenomenon often called a "broadcast storm." The fundamental problem, therefore, is to impose a logical structure on this physical chaos. Clustering is the most prominent technique for achieving this, partitioning the network into manageable groups, or clusters. Each cluster is coordinated by a cluster head (CH), and these CHs collectively form a virtual backbone for more efficient inter-cluster communication.

A powerful and theoretically sound approach to selecting these cluster heads is to compute a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) of the network graph. An MIS is a set of nodes where no two are direct neighbors, and which cannot be expanded further. This structure guarantees that every node in the network is either a CH or is adjacent to one, forming a dominating set that effectively covers the entire network. While elegant in theory, the practical implementation is difficult. Naive algorithms for maintaining an MIS in a dynamic environment often suffer from a critical flaw: instability. A single node changing its status can trigger a cascade of changes throughout the network, an issue known as the "ripple effect of re-clustering." The network can end up spending more resources on maintaining the cluster structure than on transmitting data. This paper proposes a modified MIS-based clustering algorithm with a primary focus on stability, introducing localized and event-driven maintenance rules designed to suppress this ripple effect and create a more robust network hierarchy.

% If you would like to get a good grade for your project, you have to write a good report.  Your project will be assessed mostly based on the report. Examiners are not mind-readers, and cannot give credit for work which you have done but not included in the report~\cite{York2017}.

% Here is the Stanford InfoLab's patented five-point structure for Introductions. Unless there's a good argument against it, the Introduction should consist of five paragraphs answering the following five questions:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item What is the problem?
% \item Why is it interesting and important? What do you gain when you solve the problem, and what do you miss if you do not solve it?
% \item Why is it hard? (e.g., why do naive approaches fail?)
% \item Why hasn't it been solved before? What's wrong with previous proposed solutions? How does yours differ?
% \item What are the key components of your approach and results including any specific limitations.
% \end{enumerate}

% Then have a final paragraph or subsection: ``Summary of Contributions". It should list the major contributions in bullet form, mentioning in which sections they can be found. This material doubles as an outline of the rest of the paper, saving space and eliminating redundancy.

% %%%

% According to \cite{algorithmic2009}, algorithmic complexity of clustering is NP-Complete for simple undirected graphs, and research on MANETs may use unit disks to represent its topology.

% A successful approach to alleviate the burden of maintenance in large MANETs is to decompose the network into clusters and then work on the maintenance of the clusters instead of each and every node directly \cite{algorithmic2009}.



\section{Background and Related Work}

\subsection{Background}

% This section (1 page at most for background) provides the background information needed for the rest of your report to be understood. 
The core of our work lies at the intersection of graph theory and wireless networking. A Mobile Ad Hoc Network (\textbf{MANET}) can be modeled as an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of mobile nodes and $E$ is the set of communication links between them. Establishing a stable and efficient network \textbf{backbone} is crucial for scalability.

\subsection{Dominating and Independent Sets}

To achieve network coverage, we first introduce the concept of a \textbf{Dominating Set (DS)}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dominating Set (DS)}: A subset of vertices $D \subseteq V$ such that every vertex not in $D$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $D$. This ensures full network coverage, as every node is either in the backbone or directly connected to it.
    \item The optimization goal is often to find a \textbf{Minimum Dominating Set (Min-DS)}, the smallest possible DS, a problem that is $\text{NP}$-hard.
\end{itemize}

In contrast, an \textbf{Independent Set (IS)} focuses on separation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Independent Set (IS)}: A subset of vertices $I \subseteq V$ such that \textbf{no two vertices} in $I$ are adjacent \cite{Wattenhofer2016}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Maximal Independent Sets (MIS) and Dominating Independent Sets}

A key structure for clustering is one that satisfies \emph{both} properties simultaneously.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Maximal Independent Set (MIS)}: An Independent Set $I$ that cannot be extended; it is not a proper subset of any other Independent Set \cite{Wattenhofer2016}.
    \item A \textbf{Maximal Independent Set} is, by definition, also a \textbf{Dominating Set}.
    \item Therefore, the set of all \textbf{MISs} is identical to the set of all \textbf{Independent Dominating Sets (IDSs)}.
\end{itemize}

This property makes the MIS an ideal candidate for selecting Cluster Heads (\textbf{CHs}) because the nodes in the MIS are guaranteed to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Cover the network} (Dominating property).
    \item \textbf{Be spatially separated} (Independent property), which is beneficial for reducing interference and reusing wireless channel resources.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Maximum vs. Minimum Cardinality Sets}

While an MIS is a structural property, we often seek to optimize its size, which introduces the maximum and minimum cardinality problems. Let $i(G)$ be the minimum size of an MIS and $\alpha(G)$ be the maximum size of an IS.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Cardinality Properties of Independent and Dominating Sets}
    \label{tab:cardinality}
    \begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{6cm}|p{5.5cm}|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Concept} & \textbf{Property / Defining Set} & \textbf{Optimization/Complexity} \\
        \hline
        \textbf{MaxIS} & An \textbf{Independent Set (IS)} with the \textbf{largest possible cardinality}, $\alpha(G)$. & \textbf{Goal:} Maximize the size of the IS. \newline \textbf{Complexity:} $\text{NP}$-hard \cite{Wattenhofer2016} \\
        \hline
        \textbf{Min-IDS} & An \textbf{MIS/IDS} with the \textbf{smallest possible cardinality}, $i(G)$. & \textbf{Goal:} Minimize the backbone size. \newline \textbf{Complexity:} $\text{NP}$-hard \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Here, \textbf{MaxIS} stands for \textit{Maximum Independent Set} and \textbf{Min-IDS} stands for \textit{Minimum Independent Dominating Set}.

The relationship between these concepts is hierarchical:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The set of all $\mathbf{MaxISs}$ is a subset ($\subseteq$) of the set of all \textbf{Independent Sets} ($\mathbf{ISs}$), as a MaxIS is simply one of the ISs that achieves the maximum size $\alpha(G)$.
    \item The set of all $\mathbf{Min-IDSs}$ is a subset ($\subseteq$) of the set of all \textbf{MISs} (or $\mathbf{IDSs}$), as a Min-IDS is simply one of the MISs that achieves the minimum size $i(G)$.
\end{itemize}

Our work leverages the properties of the \textbf{MIS} to create a clustered backbone, focusing on efficient and distributed construction strategies for these complex, yet powerful, network structures.

\subsection{Related Work}

The use of dominating sets for routing in MANETs is a well-established field. The work on constructing a Connected Dominating Set (CDS) is a foundational contribution in the field \cite{wuli2004maximal}. While effective, the maintenance of a CDS can incur significant overhead as the topology changes. Building on this, many algorithms have focused specifically on using an MIS for clustering. The greedy distributed algorithms that serve as a common baseline for MIS construction are detailed in \cite{algorithmic2009}, where nodes make local decisions based on neighbor information to join the set. These algorithms highlight the fundamental distributed logic required.

The most critical challenge, however, is not the initial formation but the ongoing maintenance of the cluster structure. A comprehensive overview of clustering costs, which formally identifies the "ripple effect of re-clustering" as a primary source of inefficiency, is provided in a key survey of the field \cite{Yu1423333}. This analysis underscores that an algorithm's value is determined not just by the quality of its initial clusters, but by its ability to maintain them with minimal overhead. In response to this stability challenge, several mobility-aware schemes have been proposed. For example, some algorithms attempt to select CHs with the lowest relative mobility compared to their neighbors. While this can create very stable clusters, its effectiveness is largely limited to scenarios with predictable, group-based mobility, such as in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) \cite{surveyonvehicular2020}. Other approaches tackle stability from a theoretical standpoint, proposing self-stabilizing algorithms that guarantee convergence to a valid clustered state from any arbitrary initial configuration \cite{Flauzac5279437}. Our work addresses the gap for a more general-purpose solution by retaining the simple and robust MIS framework but augmenting it with new, localized maintenance rules specifically designed to dampen the ripple effect in a wide range of mobility scenarios.

% The perennial question: Should related work be covered near the beginning of the paper or near the end?
% \textbf{Beginning}: if it can be short yet detailed enough, or if it's critical to take a strong defensive stance about previous work right away. In this case Related Work can be either a subsection at the end of the Introduction, or its own Section 2~\cite{Widom2006}. \textbf{End}: if it can be summarized quickly early on (in the Introduction or Preliminaries), or if sufficient comparisons require the technical content of the paper. In this case Related Work should appear just before the Conclusions, possibly in a more general section `Discussion and Related Work''~\cite{Widom2006}.

\section{Main Contributions}

You can introduce multiple sections for presenting your contribution. Provide content specific titles. 

\subsection{Your Contribution 1}

Present your proposals, algorithms, techniques etc. here.

\subsection{Your Contribution 2}

Present your proposals, algorithms, techniques etc. here.


\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Methodology}
Writing the methodology lies at the core of the paper, and fulfills one of the basic principles underlying the scientific method. Any scientific paper needs to be verifiable by other researchers, so that they can review the results by replicating the experiment and guaranteeing the validity. To assist this, you need to give a completely accurate description of the equipment and the techniques used for gathering the data~\cite{Shuttleworth2016}.

Other scientists are not going to take your word for it, and they want to be able to evaluate whether your methodology is sound. In addition, it is useful for the reader to understand how you obtained your data, because it allows them to evaluate the quality of the results. For example, if you were trying to obtain data about shopping preferences, you will obtain different results from a multiple-choice questionnaire than from a series of open interviews. Writing methodology allows the reader to make their own decision about the validity of the data. If the research about shopping preferences were built upon a single case study, it would have little external validity, and the reader would treat the results with the contempt that they deserve~\cite{Shuttleworth2016}.

Describe the materials and equipment used in the research. Explain how the samples were gathered, any randomization techniques and how the samples were prepared. Explain how the measurements were made and what calculations were performed upon the raw data. Describe the statistical techniques used upon the data~\cite{Shuttleworth2016}.


\subsection{Results}
This is probably the most variable part of any research paper, and depends upon the results and aims of the experiment. For quantitative research, it is a presentation of the numerical results and data, whereas for qualitative research it should be a broader discussion of trends, without going into too much detail. For research generating a lot of results, then it is better to include tables or graphs of the analyzed data and leave the raw data in the appendix, so that a researcher can follow up and check your calculations. A commentary is essential to linking the results together, rather than displaying isolated and unconnected charts, figures and findings. It can be quite difficulty to find a good balance between the results and the discussion section, because some findings, especially in a quantitative or descriptive experiment, will fall into a grey area. As long as you not repeat yourself to often, then there should be no major problem. It is best to try to find a middle course, where you give a general overview of the data and then expand upon it in the discussion - you should try to keep your own opinions and interpretations out of the results section, saving that for the discussion~\cite{Shuttleworth2016}.

\subsection{Discussion}
This is where you elaborate upon your findings, and explain what you found, adding your own personal interpretations. Ideally, you should link the discussion back to the introduction, addressing each initial point individually. It is important to try to make sure that every piece of information in your discussion is directly related to the thesis statement, or you risk clouding your findings. You can expand upon the topic in the conclusion - remembering the hourglass principle~\cite{Shuttleworth2016}.


\section{Conclusion}
In general a short summarizing paragraph will do, and under no circumstances should the paragraph simply repeat material from the Abstract or Introduction. In some cases it's possible to now make the original claims more concrete, e.g., by referring to quantitative performance results~\cite{Widom2006}.

The conclusion is where you build upon your discussion and try to refer your findings to other research and to the world at large. In a short research paper, it may be a paragraph or two, or practically non-existent. In a dissertation, it may well be the most important part of the entire paper - not only does it describe the results and discussion in detail, it emphasizes the importance of the results in the field, and ties it in with the previous research. Some research papers require a recommendations section, postulating that further directions of the research, as well as highlighting how any flaws affected the results. In this case, you should suggest any improvements that could be made to the research design~\cite{Shuttleworth2016}.

\section{About Appendices}

Appendices should contain detailed proofs and algorithms only. Appendices can be crucial for overlength papers, but are still useful otherwise. Think of appendices as random-access substantiation of underlying gory details. As a rule of thumb: (1) Appendices should not contain any material necessary for understanding the contributions of the paper. (2) Appendices should contain all material that most readers would not be interested in ~\cite{Widom2006}.
